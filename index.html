          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to give the content structure.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS): programming language used by developers to define how a webpage content is presented to users.</li>
            <li>inline CSS: syling an element directly in the HTML file applied to a a specific HTML tag. Useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets because each inline style nust be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li>internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rule only applies to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
            <li>external CSS style sheet: the most common way to syle a webpage. This is preffered in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>Declarations: contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>margin property: indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer.</li>
            <li>padding property: adds space around the content insed an element.</li>
            <li>class attribute: allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning a rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
