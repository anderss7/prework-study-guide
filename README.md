# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a brand new student to coding bootcamp, I wanted to make sure I was prepared for success. 
There is a lot of information to learn even in the Prework that at some point I wasn't sure how I was going to keep track of all the new inforamtion I was learning.
I decided to create a webpage to store and keep track of all the notes I have taken so far.
By creating a dedicated webpage, I am able to easily access and refer to my notes any time, anywhere.
I am also able to share these notes with my fellow classmates easier.
Along the way, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I also learned what tools I would need to become a successful student and developer in the future.
